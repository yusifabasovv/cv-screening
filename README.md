# CV Screening Project

The CV Screening project is a tool that allows users to input a CV (in PDF format) and a job requirements file (in DOCX format). The tool then generates a summary of the CV and scores how suitable the applicant is for the job based on the provided requirements. This project utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 model to generate the summary.

## Project Structure

The project folder has the following structure:

```
cv_screening/
│   app.py
│   config.yml
│   requirement.txt
│   utils.py
```

- `app.py`: This is the main file of the project that contains the code for running the CV screening tool.
- `config.yml`: This YAML file contains the API key for OpenAI and the prompt for the OpenAI model.
- `requirement.txt`: This file lists the required libraries and dependencies for the project.
- `utils.py`: This file contains utility functions, including the `read_yaml` function to read data from YAML files.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

2. Edit the `config.yml` file and provide your OpenAI API key and the desired prompt for the model.

3. Run the `app.py` file using the following command:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. The tool will launch a web interface using Gradio. You can upload a PDF resume and a DOCX requirements file.

5. Adjust the model parameters using the slider for temperature and the dropdown for model type.

6. Click the "Submit" button to get a summary of the CV and the suitability score for the job.

## Note

- The `cv_screening` class in `app.py` contains functions for preprocessing files and interacting with the OpenAI model.
- The `validate_candidate` function reads the input files, converts PDF to DOCX, generates prompts, and gets responses from the GPT model.
- The `run_gradio` function sets up the Gradio interface for user interaction.

Remember to replace the example file paths and names with your actual file paths and names in the `__main__` section of the `app.py` file.

For more information on using Gradio and OpenAI models, you can refer to their respective documentation.
