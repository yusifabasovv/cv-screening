# CV Screening Project

The **CV Screening** project is a tool that allows users to assess the suitability of job applicants based on their CVs and job requirements. The system takes in a CV in PDF format and a job requirements document in DOCX format, processes the information, generates a summary of the CV, and provides a score indicating how well the applicant matches the job requirements.

## Features

- Converts PDF CVs to DOCX format for processing.
- Extracts text from DOCX files.
- Utilizes OpenAI's Chat API to generate summaries and scores.
- Provides a user-friendly interface using Gradio.

## Folder Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

```
cv-screening/
│-- app.py
│-- config.yml
│-- requirement.txt
│-- utils.py
│-- LICENSE

```

- `app.py`: The main Python script that contains the CVScreening class and functions for PDF to DOCX conversion, text extraction, and OpenAI integration. It also defines the user interface using Gradio.
- `config.yml`: Configuration file that holds API keys and prompts for the OpenAI model.
- `requirement.txt`: List of required Python libraries for the project.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions, including a YAML file reader.
